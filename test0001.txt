What's an Apprentice?

As everyone knows, opportunities in the skilled trades are set to explode in the next five to ten years.

Many skilled trades train workers through apprenticeships - new workers spend up to 80% of their days learning on the job, and only 20% in the classroom. This is accomplished through being paired with an expert in the trade who will guide the apprentice through their learning process.

Many countries have developed special ¡±¡±pre-apprenticeship¡±¡± secondary school programs. If you are in high school, by participating in these programs you can learn job skills and earn credits towards your apprenticeship before you even graduate. Apprenticeships range from auto mechanics to cabinetmaking, construction, and pastry making

(a) Anyone who spends 20% of his or her time inside a classroom

(b) An expert in a skilled trade who spends 80% of his or her time on the job

(c) Any high school student who is learning job skills

(d) A new worker matched with an expert to learn a skilled trade

054.How can high school students earn credits towards their apprenticeships?
